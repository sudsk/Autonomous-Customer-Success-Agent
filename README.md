### 1. Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your TiDB and OpenAI credentials

# Run backend
python app.py
```

### 2. Setup Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Live Demo

## 🎬 Demo Script (Under 4 Minutes)

### **Opening (30s): The Problem**
- "Customer churn kills businesses. 73% of SaaS companies lose customers they could have saved."
- "Meet the AI agent that fights back."

### **Live Demo (2.5m): The Hero In Action**
1. **🚨 Alert** (30s): "Sarah Chen at 89% churn risk - $14.4K revenue at risk"
2. **🧠 Analysis** (45s): Agent finds similar cases using TiDB vector search
3. **⚡ Action** (60s): Generates personalized email, sends automatically  
4. **🔄 Self-Correction** (45s): Email bounces → Agent tries phone call → Success!
5. **✅ Victory** (30s): "Customer Saved! Churn risk: 89% → 23%"

### **Impact (45s): The Results**
- Dashboard showing 847 customers saved
- $2.3M monthly revenue retained
- 67% churn rate reduction
- 94.7% agent autonomy

### **Close (15s): The Power**
- "Autonomous customer success powered by TiDB Serverless"
- "The future of customer retention is here"

## 📊 Business Impact
